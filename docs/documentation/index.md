# Documentation

This chapter explains the API and the mechanics behind `Maleo`, and how to implement your own integration to `Maleo`
like your own [Logger] or [Messenger].

There are three core concepts you have to understand when customizing `Maleo`.

## [Logger]

[Logger], in Maleo's perspective, is an output for a User that can be considered fast and robust, can handle hundreds
and thousands of User inputs under one second.

[Logger]: ./logger/index.md
[Messenger]: ./messenger/index.md
[Engine]: ./engine/index.md
